Now She Is Six by A. A. Milne

When she was One,
She had just begun.
When she was Two,
She was nearly new.
When she was Three
She was hardly herself.
When she was Four,
She was not much more.
When she was Five,
She was just alive.
But now she is Six,
She is as clever as clever,
So she thinks she will be six now for ever and ever.
